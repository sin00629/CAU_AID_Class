# Usage

1. Run the script:  
   `python knn_iris_classfier.py`
2. Enter the number of neighbors(`k`) when prompted.
3. View the model's accuracy in the console.
4. Input `sepal.length` and `petal.length` in the format `value1,valu2` to predict the iris species.

# Example
### console Interaction:  
```
Enter the number of neighbors (k) for KNN: 5  
Model Accuracy: 0.95  
Balanced Accuracy: 0.96  
Enter the sepal.length and petal.length for the iris in the format 'sepal_length,petal_length': 1.5,3.2  
Predicted Label:  Setosa
```

# Notes
- Ensure that the input for predictions is numeric and follows the correct format (`value1,value2`).
- Modify the dataset loading path in the script if necessary.
